JSL01

This project i learned to find ways and follow logic to solve a problem. I was strugling to find a way to put together the logic that makes it possible to create code that effective. I Found a site that gave me the steps to 
follow when beginnig a new code. They involve:
1. Understand the Problem:

Reading Carefully Take your time to read the question thoroughly. what the question is asking you to do.
Breaking it Down, If the problem seems complex, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. What are the inputs? What are the expected outputs?

2. Identify the Concepts:

Core Concepts: What core JavaScript concepts are involved in the question (e.g., variables, data types, loops, functions)?
Specific Functionality: Does the question require using specific JavaScript features (e.g., DOM manipulation, events)?
3. Ask Guiding Questions:

Logic Flow: How can I achieve the desired outcome using JavaScript's logic? Can I use a loop, conditional statement, or function?
Data Manipulation: How should I handle the data (numbers, strings, arrays, objects)? What operations or transformations are needed?
Testing and Debugging: How can I test my code to ensure it works as expected? What are some common debugging strategies in JavaScript?

I am doing practice questions and putting together ways to put into practice this logic
