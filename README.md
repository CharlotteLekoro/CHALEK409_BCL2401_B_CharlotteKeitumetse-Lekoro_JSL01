JSL01

This project i learned to find ways and follow logic to solve a problem. I was strugling to find a way to put together the logic that makes it possible to create code that effective. I Found a site that gave me the steps to follow when beginnig a new code. They involve: taking time to understand what the queation is asking to do, then break it down into smaller parts the inputs and outputs of a task.

2. Find the Javascript concepts involved in the question like loops, variables, functions etc...
3. Next will be the desired outcome of the task, how must the data be handled; strings, arrays
4. Checking how the code is funstioning by console.log
5. I am doing practice questions and putting together ways to put into practice this logic
